# Manto

_Manto_ (Portuguese for **cloak**) is a local‑first, FOSS‑friendly Markdown CMS built with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/).  
Think of it as a lightweight cloak for your notes, docs, and ideas — simple, elegant, and entirely yours.

---

## ✨ Features (MVP)

- **Local‑first**: All content lives in plain `.md` files under `priv/content/`.
- **Live editor**: Split‑pane editor with real‑time Markdown preview.
- **MDEx powered**: Fast, extensible Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting, emoji shortcodes, and sanitization.
- **Git‑friendly**: Content is just files — version them however you like.
- **No lock‑in**: Clone, run, and hack locally. No external services required.

## 🚀 Quickstart

Clone and run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uminocelo/manto
cd manto
mix setup
mix phx.server
```

Open http://localhost:4000/editor in your browser. 
Start editing `priv/content/welcome.md` and see changes live.
